## Getting started

git clone https://github.com/AboutGoods/go-web-boilerplate.git MyProject
```

Then, if you want to rename your module, you can edit this first line of your go.mod.  

âš  If you change it, some files will show new issues because they depend on this package. For example in ```http/controllers/DefaultController.go```
```
import (
    "App/database"
```


Then download all the dependencies using
```bash
go mod download
```

After this, you can run your app using 

```bash
go run App
